Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a popular method of managing storage on Linux operating systems. It allows administrators to create and manage logical volumes, which can span multiple physical disks and can be resized on-the-fly. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of configuring LVM on Linux.

<h2>Install LVM Tools</h2>
<p>The first step is to make sure that the LVM tools are installed on your Linux system. Most Linux distributions come with the LVM tools pre-installed, but you can make sure of it by running the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install lvm2    # for debian-based distros
sudo yum install lvm2        # for RedHat-based distros
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now that you have it installed let's start creating multiple PVs and then add them to a VG.</p>

<h2>Create Physical Volumes</h2>
<p>LVM operates on physical volumes (PVs), which can be disks or disk partitions. Before creating logical volumes, you need to create one or more physical volumes. For example, if you have a new disk attached to your system, you can create a physical volume on it using the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command creates a physical volume on the <code>/dev/sdb</code> device. By the same command we will create the second Physical Volume on <code>/dev/sdc</code>.</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Create Volume Groups</h2>
<p>A volume group (VG) is a collection of one or more physical volumes. You can create a volume group using the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command creates a volume group named <code>vg1</code> that contains the physical volumes <code>/dev/sdb</code> and <code>/dev/sdc</code>. And you can now see your volume group by <code>vgs</code> or <code>vgdisplay</code> command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo vgdisplay vg1
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Resizing Volume Groups</h2>
<p>If you want to add a new physical volume to a volume group you may extend it by using the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo vgextend vg1 /dev/sdd
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can also remove a physical volume from volume group with <code>vgreduce</code> command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo vgreduce vg1 /dev/sdd
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Create Logical Volumes</h2>
<p>A logical volume (LV) is a virtual partition that resides within a volume group. You can create a logical volume using the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n lv1 vg1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command creates a logical volume named <code>lv1</code> that is 10GB in size and resides within the volume group <code>vg1</code>.</p>

<h2>Format and Mount Logical Volumes</h2>
<p>Once you have created a logical volume, you need to format it with a file system and mount it. You can format a logical volume with a file system using the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg1/lv1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command formats the logical volume <code>lv1</code>, which resides in the volume group <code>vg1</code>, with the <code>ext4</code> file system.</p>

<p>You can mount the logical volume to a directory like this:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
sudo mount /dev/vg1/lv1 /mnt/lv1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command mounts the logical volume <code>lv1</code>, which resides in the volume group <code>vg1</code>, to the directory <code>/mnt/lv1</code>.</p>

<h2>Resizing Logical Volumes</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of using LVM is that you can resize logical volumes on-the-fly. To resize a logical volume, you can use the following command:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
sudo lvresize -L +5G /dev/vg1/lv1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This command increases the size of the logical volume <code>lv1</code> by 5GB.</p>
